# ncurses-battleship
A battleship game using the ncurses library.

<h2> Purpose of the project </h2>

This project was meant to practice writing functions and using the ncurses library in the C programming language. If I was to make changes and improve this program now, (aside from troubleshooting the hard mode of the game), I would try to make the menus even more visual and intuitive for the player to navigate, and add a two palyer mode where only one board displays the visible ships at a time so you could play with a friend instead of only against an AI.

<h2> Video demonstration of compiling and running </h2>
